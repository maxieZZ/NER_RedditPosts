went to pick up my script today for the first time, at a new pharmacy, since moving to a new side of town. i get up to the counter and speak with the pharmacy counter staff, and tell them i have a script ready. the pharmacy tech puts in my information in the computer, and checks my id. she then tells me she needs the pharmacist to sign off on my script (ok?) so the pharmacist comes over and looks at the screen, asks the girl working the desk if she id'd me (she says yes), and then *he* asks for my id *again* so *he* can see it\\\\*.\\\\*\\n\\nbut it doesn't stop there, he then tells me without a second form of id i can't get my script. im sort of annoyed at this point so i fight him back, tell him i have never had to show two forms of id in the three years i have been picking up this prescription, and argue that my id isn't damaged in any way that makes it illegible.\\n\\nhe then grumbles and turns around without saying anything. he comes back with my script, and before handing it to me he asks \\\"what do you plan to do with this medicine?\\\" and i am just baffled at what i'm hearing. i just say \\\"i'm probably going to take it\\\" in a sarcastic tone because i'm angry by this point, then he asks \\\"how often do you take it?\\\" and i said \\\"whenever i need to.\\\" the pharmacist then gets really stern with his voice and says \\\"no. you take this every day or don't take it at all. understand? you should know that.\\\"\\n\\ni was going to tell him that is absolutely not what my doctor recommended but i didn't feel like arguing. i just said ok and left.\\n\\nhas anyone else here gotten that advice or do i just need to drive an extra 10 minutes a month to a different pharmacy to not deal with this guy again?\\n\\ntldr: pharmacist at my new
